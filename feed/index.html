										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Spring Awakening by FaithRR </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Take a look around and you might notice something. For one thing, Summer is coming!</p>
<p>Here in the United States, people are talking on lawns in the suburbs and the newspapers don&#8217;t make much sense. Weddings are being planned and the cost of margarine went up again.</p>
<p>Children are going to Spring Carnivals and being tested in quiet classrooms. The end of the Fiscal Year is almost upon us and hands are being shaken and wrung. They say it will be a bad year for apples.</p>
<p>In the midst of it all, the beautiful dreamers are waking up and finding their ways to the parks again. They are making plans for travels and parties and they are marching in the streets.</p>
<p>They are even renting buses!</p>
<p>In support of the global revolution of the human heart and the reclamation of what is possible within the world, Mindful Occupation is committed to offering support for sustainable collaborative activism.</p>
<p>Working from the principles of mutual aid, Mindful Occupation seeks to foster opportunities for solidarity building, story and skill sharing, peer support, and collective networking.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re looking to empower ourselves to support one another in the process of effective revolution and to create opportunities for resolution, celebration, and reclamation.</p>
<p>Although many are familiar with mindfulness, many are not. To those who do live mindfully, the practice can mean many different things. Mindfulness is, to some, a highly individualized attunement to the truth of the world that surrounds us. Some associate mindfulness with a distinct shift in perspective and objectivity, an awareness of vast relation and a renewal of meaning or lack thereof.</p>
<p>A big part of mindfulness is intentional reflection and orientation to our relationship with the world internal and the world external. We cannot be in the present if we are lodged in any corner &#8211; internal, external, past or the future.</p>
<p>However, it is helpful to be aware of all that brought us to this point and all of the ways that we wish ourselves forward. It is from these things that the here and now, so fleeting and full, is constructed. It is from this space held in the midst of it all that we can begin to be truly attentive and boldly conduct ourselves in accordance with the best of what we&#8217;ve learned and full of hope for what is possible. It from this space that we create our futures.</p>
<p>That being said, as we launch Mindful Occupation, it&#8217;d be nice to consider what we have accomplished and where it has brought us.</p>
<p>We have done the world an invaluable service in helping to raise awareness of the effects of corporate and military domination on the quality of our lives, economies and cultures.</p>
<p>We have offered powerful models for effective change and have changed the landscape of language and possibility.</p>
<p>We have laughed and cried and we have yelled and celebrated. We have sang and we have clapped our hands and we have raised our fists. We have shared meals and we have shared cells. We have made infinite stories and have, in fact, changed the course of the world.</p>
<p>The 99% is going to win. That is where we have been and it is where we are now and it is where we are going.</p>
<p>By establishing safe and supportive spaces and an ethos of mutual aid, Mindful Occupation will encourage and mentor sustainable activism, provide opportunities for collective and personal empowerment.</p>
<p>We hope that this resource will be used to strengthen activist communities and support cohesion in outreach and actions.</p>
<p>The first big print run of Mindful Occupation: Rising Up Without Burning Out is coming up soon and Drafts are already being used to organize Mindful Occupation groups to support Summer actions and movement building.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;d like ideas or support in starting a Mindful Occupation group, feel free to let us know.</p>
<p>Mindful Occupation Tip:</p>
<p>Are the birds singing? Listen.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: 'MomsTypewriter';">Mutual Aid Groups and Listening Spaces (as used by The Icarus Project)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Breaking through the walls and making a connection can mean all the difference in the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Mutual aid and support groups are a way to bring down the walls that isolate us. No one in the group is above anyone else: mutual aid means we listen to and support each other as a community of equals, without paid professionals or staff to define who we are. Each of us is an expert on our own experience, and each of us is the center for our decisions— and we are not alone. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">When we gather together with people who&#8217;ve been through what we&#8217;ve been through, people who share some of the mysteries and suffering that get labeled &#8220;mental illness,&#8221; we discover new maps through crisis, learn new tools to stay healthy, and weave communities of solidarity to change the world. We discover something at the heart of the dangerous gift of madness: caring for others is often the best way to care for ourselves. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MomsTypewriter';">Listening Spaces </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">There is a wide diversity of group models to draw on, and we encourage you to experiment to find the best fit for you. All these approaches, however, share the same essential principle: create a space for listening. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">In nature, stillness, silence, and sky create a vast container for what is essential to emerge. Step into wilderness and you encounter a hushed patience and gentle holding rare in the noisy, sped-up clash and clamor of our lives. Corporate monocropped culture suppresses true listening and imposes labels, rigid habits, and preconceived notions. Real support and caring means breaking down habitual ways of interacting, and meeting each other in spaces of true, effective listening.</span></p>

Don&#8217;t jump in. If time </span><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">is an issue, the group should decide on what&#8217;s fair and stick to it.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';">= </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Don&#8217;t react or speak up automatically. Watch how your reactions to what others say reflect your own experience, not the person speaking. Give yourself time to respond from a deeper place. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';">= </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Listen as a receiver, not as a critic. Imagine different perspectives and experiences, rather than assuming they&#8217;re just like yours. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MomsTypewriter';">Facilitation and Self-Facilitation </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">With their roots in effective listening, groups can nurture healing and community through facilitation. Facilitators help the group listen more effectively, and pay specific attention to the overall needs and direction of everyone involved, not just their own individual needs. The facilitator should avoid bias, and if they are too involved with a particular group topic then someone else might be better in the role. It helps when two people facilitate and when facilitators reflect group diversity such as gender, age, and race. It is also good to pair more experienced and less experienced facilitators, and to offer new people a chance to learn facilitation skills. </span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">Importantly, everyone should keep overall group needs in mind, and everyone can assist the group through self-facilitation.</span></p>

Suggest breaks, exercises, games, or agenda and time revisions when necessary. If conversation is lagging, ask questions, tell a story, or get up and do some stretching. Sometimes if the group is stuck, the facilitator can ask a clarifying question, reframe an issue, or connect points to earlier discussion. </span></p>

Talking about other people or gossiping takes focus away from your own experience. </span></p>

Nature isn&#8217;t always neat and orderly. Sometimes wild conversation, spontaneity, and &#8220;breaking all the rules of facillitation&#8221; is exactly what the group needs in the moment. A skilled facillitator and skilled participants can feel when the chaos and cacophany that erupt are refreshing and true to the group spirit, and when to go with it. Then comes the time to reel it all back in and return to the basic structure of taking turns and listening carefully. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: SkitchOrnamentsFill;">= </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Candara;">Respect different views and choices, such as diagnosis, medication, recreational drugs, nutrition, medical care, holistic health, exercise, spirituality, lifestyle, and other decisions. Change is difficult! People grow at their own pace, and you may not really know what is best for another person, because you are not them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: SkitchOrnamentsFill;">= </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Candara;">Accommodate limitations and access needs, such as mobility accessibility and sign language interpretation. Be aware of how choices of where to hold meetings might affect people, such as institutional settings like clinics or health centers that can trigger painful memories, or places with toxic substances (fresh paint, new furniture or carpets) that people might be chemically sensitive to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: SkitchOrnamentsFill;">= </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Candara;">Identify and discuss how power and privilege play out by understanding how white supremacy, patriarchy, classism, heterosexism, ableism, and all other forms of oppression affect each of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: SkitchOrnamentsFill;">= </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Candara;">Intervene in situations where people are making oppressive comments. Re-focus on the agenda, and remind everyone of the need for group safety. Recognize the intention behind someone&#8217;s word choice, and give them an opportunity to correct themselves or recognize how their words might be offensive. It can help to say, &#8220;When I just heard you say that, some people might feel you used an inappropriate or disrespectful term. Can you reword that statement?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: SkitchOrnamentsFill;">= </span><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Candara;">Remember that including marginalized voices and overcoming oppression helps everyone&#8217;s liberation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: Candara;">When we listen to each other effectively, we begin to understand our needs and how to meet them. Icarus groups can become places to nurture community networks of mutual aid and advocacy, help each other through crisis, deal with the mental health system, and learn about new options and resources.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'ErasITC'; font-weight: 500;">This gathering has some basic agreements to ensure inclusion, safety, and open dialogue: </span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'ErasITC'; font-weight: 500;">
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'ErasITC'; font-weight: 500;">We &#8220;listen like allies.&#8221; We respect a wide diversity of choices and perspectives, even when we disagree, and we don’t judge or invalidate other people’s experiences. We try not to interrupt. When it’s our turn to speak, we can ask others for feedback and advice, or just have people listen without responding. All responses are in a positive spirit of support and respect. </span></p>
</li>
<li style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'ErasITC'; font-weight: 500;">
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'ErasITC'; font-weight: 500;">We also practice &#8220;step up, step back.&#8221; People who are quiet are encouraged to speak, and those who talk a lot are encouraged to give others a chance. We invite new people to introduce themselves if they want. And silence is also always ok. </span></p>
</li>
<li style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'ErasITC'; font-weight: 500;">
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'ErasITC'; font-weight: 500;">As a community, we try to use &#8220;owl vision,&#8221; the ability to listen closely to the speaker while also having a feeling for the needs of the whole group. Keep in mind that others might be waiting to speak, or when we all might need to take a break. </span></p>
</li>
<li style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'ErasITC'; font-weight: 500;">
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'ErasITC'; font-weight: 500;">We recognize that overcoming oppression helps everyone’s liberation; it is the group’s responsibility to challenge racism, classism, sexism, ageism, homophobia, and other forms of </span>prejudice. We educate each other in the spirit of solidarity, and hold others accountable for their behavior without criticizing who they are as people.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ErasITC; font-weight: 500;">
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ErasITC; font-weight: 500;">We respect spiritual beliefs, altered states of consciousness, and definitions of reality that fall outside the mainstream material view.</span></p>
</li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ErasITC; font-weight: 500;">
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ErasITC; font-weight: 500;">In order to be as clear as possible, we try to use “I&#8221; statements when speaking to the group. This helps us avoid misunderstandings, and invokes trust and sensitivity.</span></p>
</li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ErasITC; font-weight: 500;">
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ErasITC; font-weight: 500;">We try to pay attention to repeating patterns in each other’s lives, in order to identify root causes. We try to notice common themes and roles that we play out together as a group.</span></p>
</li>
<li style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ErasITC; font-weight: 500;">
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ErasITC; font-weight: 500;">To create trust we respect confidentiality. The group decides on what level of disclosure and openness outside the group we want.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-family: ErasITC; font-weight: 500;">This is a work in progress. We need everyone’s feedback and ideas of how to improve our efforts and strengthen our group. And as we meet, keep in mind that there are many other people gathering like this to build community support networks with a vision of a new world.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">General Experience Only: </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Members may discuss what they and others say and do with people outside the group, but only generally, without any names, details, or clues about the specific people or events. This is a common policy, used in the NYC Icarus Group and Freedom Center: it supports discussion of sensitive topics such as abuse, criminal behavior, and suicide, while allowing participants to take what they learn to the rest of the world. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">Personal Experience Only: </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">&#8220;What&#8217;s said here stays here.&#8221; Participants may discuss what they themselves say and do with people outside the group, but may not talk about, or even refer generally, to what others say or do. This is a more restrictive policy used for groups, such as 12- step groups, that focus specifically on difficult topics such as addiction and abuse. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">Full Disclosure: </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Group participants are free to talk about anything that happened in the group. While common for activist organizations and public events that want to get the word out freely, this approach should be weighed carefully for groups providing mutual emotional support. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">Total Non-Disclosure: </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Anything said or done is not repeated, or even alluded to generally, to anyone outside the group. This can be useful </span><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">for a closed group focused on a very sensitive topic, where participants want to go very deeply into personal issues over time. This is a common policy used in the RVA Icarus Group.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Every group has different needs, so while General Experience Only is the most common support group policy, the group should set its own policy.

<p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MomsTypewriter';">Example Peer Support Facilitator Notes </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Keep in mind that each group is different and unique and that it may be necessary to review and revise the format of your peer support group and the level of disclosure that is practiced. These are the notes that the facilitators of peer support groups in Richmond, Virginia&#8217;s Icarus Project group use during weekly peer support groups. Feel free to reuse and remix these notes, or make up your own entirely! </span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">

</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">If someone is uncomfortable with the person offering to facilitate, that person needs to voice their position and put in a downvote. We will only know your comfort level if you tell us! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">3. Introductions: Facilitator explains the role of a facilitator. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">A facilitator guides the group process so that it flows smoothly. In this way, the facilitator leads the group efficiently, but does not take leadership responsibility. The facilitator makes sure that everyone has an equal amount of time to speak and that no person is speaking over or interrupting someone else. The facilitator also keeps time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">As our group is non-hierarchical, we like to rotate the position of facilitator for each meeting. If you wish to volunteer to facilitate in the future, please raise your hand now or speak with me after the meeting. Inexperienced facilitators may be able to team up with more </span><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">experienced facilitators. Please do not hesitate to ask questions if you are unsure of what a facilitator does.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Almost all movements for change have had to deal with issues of power, privilege, patriarchy, internal racism, etc. Though these are the things we are working to change in our larger world (domination, oppression, greed, etc.), we&#8217;ve all grown up in these worlds of inequality, so it&#8217;s unfortunate, but we often end up a microcosm with similar problems. Tragically, sexual assault is one of these rampant problems, and some people have sexually assaulted people within some Occupy encampments. Different Occupy groups will grapple with these issues in diverse ways, but here&#8217;s some ideas. We&#8217;ve seen amazing work done by people in Occupy groups on this rotten reality—working to create an environment where these violations are less likely to occur, and to provide support if they do! A strong movement works to address its own issues, while connecting them with the larger issues they are addressing. There are many resources and models to draw from out there for dealing with these issues. See the appendix for more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Healing from sexual assault is similar to other types of traumas, but unique in its own ways, too. If friends, family, and one&#8217;s activist community respond with care and support that further empowers the survivor, it can help in the survivor&#8217;s recovery process. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Sexual assault survivors are often left with extreme feelings of shame, humiliation, powerlessness, and fear. The person who was assaulted (survivor) must be in charge of their followup. They need to know that they alone get to make the choice of whether they will go to a hospital for a forensic medical exam (commonly known as a &#8220;rape kit&#8221;), or notify police. A support person can offer suggestions, but can&#8217;t force the survivor to do anything. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">A supporter should offer to accompany the survivor to a hospital or in dealing with a police report, but should not pressure them to do either. The supporter should not touch the survivor unless given consent. If the survivor does not want to file a police report, ask them what they want to happen to the perpetrator. Let the survivor know that they do not need to make these decisions right away. However, if there is any chance that the person might consider a medical exam, and/or legal proceedings like if they are married, they can <a href="https://yaffafamilylawgroup.com/boca-raton-family-law/divorce/">file for a divorce in Boca Raton.</a> It is best if they do not shower or bathe right away, because evidence will be lost. Overall, the supporter must assure the survivor that they will do all they can to support them, and that the community will stand by the survivor&#8217;s wishes. The supporter must also do what they can to assure the survivor&#8217;s anonymity within the community. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">It may be helpful to speak anonymously with a counselor at a rape crisis center directly by calling the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1.800.656.HOPE. It will connect you with a local rape crisis center. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Many resources are listed at </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;"><a href="www.rainn.org/get-information">www.rainn.org/get-information</a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Groups may want to provide further counseling for people who are in any way affected by a sexual assault, or by how the community has dealt with it. They may also want to provide conflict resolution/ mediation as a format for people to talk things through. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Some Occupy sites have groups which specifically formed to provide support and visibility for survivor issues and issues of consent. They have created wonderful documents for accountability processes, for supporting survivors, and for community response protocols. They have worked to educate everyone engaging with Occupy about sexual assault, domestic violence, and consent. They have created trainings for people who take shifts to be on call at the encampment if an event arises. Some have released press statements in response to sexual assaults that happened at their Occupy site. Safer Spaces in NYC released a statement about a sexual assault which happened at OWS: <a href="www.nycga.net/groups/safer-spaces-committee/docs/transforming-%20harm-building-safety-confronting-sexual-violence-at-occupy-wall- street-beyond-2">www.nycga.net/groups/safer-spaces-committee/docs/transforming- harm-building-safety-confronting-sexual-violence-at-occupy-wall- street-beyond-2 </a></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">Trauma (or post-traumatic stress) is the emotional &#8220;shock&#8221; after a life-threatening, violent event. Anything that makes our body panic and go into a fight/ flight/freeze response can leave us traumatized. The effects may be immediate or take time to surface, and can be felt for the rest of our lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Being traumatized is a </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">normal response to an extreme situation; </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">even &#8220;tough&#8221; people like mothers or seasoned political activists can be traumatized. Emotional traumatization happens to everyone, no matter how &#8220;hardcore&#8221; they are. There is a tendency in activist circles for some folks to act heroic in the face of trauma. It is perfectly common, even expected, to respond to experiences of police violence and rough protest street scenes in extreme ways. There are professionals <a href="https://www.c2cfirstaidaquatics.com/brampton/">based in Brampton, c2c offers first aid training</a> for people to be prepared during emergencies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">According to<a href="https://www.cprcertificationchicago.com/"> Chicago CPR Training</a>, the causes of trauma can include almost anything: disaster, abuse, rape, witnessing violence, loss, or spending time with people who are traumatized. Because </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">trauma happens when our bodies perceive our lives are in danger and we can&#8217;t escape, </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">medical surgeries, emotional abuse, or loss of a loved one or home can also be traumatic. Even though two people may experience a similar event, one may feel traumatized by it, while the other does not. It is important not to judge others for their experience of trauma. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Trauma means getting </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">stuck in the memory </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">of a life- threatening event. Our bodies and minds act like the event is still happening, right now, even though it is in the past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">We are on guard, defensive, and &#8220;geared up,&#8221; or hopeless, paralyzed, and numb. We avoid things that remind us of the past and trigger painful memories, and we isolate ourselves from others and limit our freedom. We block out unpleasant memories and feelings, sometimes turning to drugs and alcohol. We repeat past situations. We have panic attacks or go into jumpy &#8220;fight-flight&#8221; mode, even when there is no real danger in the present. Our lives, health, and relationships with other people suffer, and </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">we live constrained and limited by our past. </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Sometimes we take our pain out on others, or become self-destructive. </span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">In the past these trauma responses were crucial to our survival, and in the present they protect us from being overwhelmed. When we value the usefulness of our trauma coping mechanisms, forgiveness and acceptance can invite gradual change.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Unfortunately </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">trauma is usually not a wound that heals just by waiting </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">for time to pass. Trauma can keep hold of our lives for many years. It is important to try to work with the trauma somehow, in whatever way is best for you. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Making connections with others and honestly expressing our feelings is important, especially when we want to hide or avoid our problems. </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">Finding safety and trust is the first step to healing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Just talking, though, may not be enough to heal trauma. </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">Sometimes talking about what happened can mean </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">reliving </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">what happened, </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">and not help. If the talking seems to go in circles or not lead to a sense of completion, it might be just stirring things up, not healing them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">It is also commonly believed that you can heal trauma by &#8220;getting it out of your system,&#8221; punching pillows, or venting strong emotions. This can be helpful, but sometimes it can end up making things worse, or even re-traumatize you. </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">Real trauma healing is usually slower and more gentle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Therapy, including EMDR, DBT, and CBT, can help many people. Others find these are not helpful. This section focuses on what we can do for each other as a community. Most importantly, </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">everyone is an individual—experiment and discover what works for you </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">and learn how to best help yourself and others. </span></p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;">
<li style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';"><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Help any bodily injury, medical issue, or physical need first </span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';"><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Don&#8217;t get up and act like nothing happened </span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';"><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Go to a safe place; help them to stay dry, warm, and still </span></li>
<li style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';"><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">If the person wants to talk, listen without interrupting or changing </span>the subject5. Remember that trembling or being emotional is part of healing, and better than &#8220;numbing out;&#8221; encourage people to feel the sensations in their body fully. (See below.)</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MinionPro'; font-weight: bold;">First Aid/Feeling Body Sensations: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Trauma cuts us off from our bodies. When we are in overwhelming danger, we dissociate or &#8220;leave our bodies&#8221; as a protective measure. Later this protective mechanism becomes stuck and counterproductive. The </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">key to healing trauma is to return to our bodies, </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">by feeling our physical sensations and making our bodies safe and alive again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Ask, &#8220;How do you know that you are sad? Is there tightness in your chest or throat? How do you know you are afraid? Is there a cold feeling, or a sinking feeling in your stomach? Feel it fully. How large is the feeling? Is it changing? What do you feel next?&#8221; Listen without interruption and give plenty of time to feel and respond. Grounding and resourcing yourself will also help the other person.</span></p>

<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Keeping eyes open usually is best for focusing on body sensations. </span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">If the person can&#8217;t feel their body at all, ask, &#8220;Can you feel your feet on the ground? Your pelvis sitting on the chair?&#8221; Grasp their hand or shoulder and say &#8220;Can you feel my hand?&#8221; </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">Always ask before touching. </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">If lying down, ask them to sit up. Ask to walk around slowly and feel their legs and feet. Or gently hold and press their feet to the ground. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">If the person is staring off in the distance, talking in circles, withdrawn, or agitated, encourage them to put their attention to the world. Ask, &#8220;Look around—what colors do you see? Can you name them?&#8221; Ask them what sensations they feel in their bodies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">When someone is preoccupied with traumatic memories, find distractions. Ask them, &#8220;When was a time that you felt safe and peaceful? Can you describe the sights, sounds, smells and colors of that time?&#8221; Ask them to feel sensations in their body. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">If the person is defensive, on guard and uncooperative, just drop it. Change the subject, go for a walk, leave the discussion/work for later. When a traumatized and defensive person perceives you as a threat, it is very difficult to convince them to just &#8220;snap out of it&#8221; or to see that they are experiencing a flashback. Wait until they are calm to discuss it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">If body sensations are too uncomfortable, try to find a sensation, even small, that is neutral or pleasant, and focus on it. Go back and forth between uncomfortable and pleasant senations. Notice any relaxation in breathing, warmth, or trembling. This is normal; feel the sensations fully. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Feelings of fear, guilt, loss, sadness, or anger are normal when we are traumatized. Don&#8217;t judge feelings in yourself or others. Listen with acceptance and care. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MinionPro'; font-weight: bold;">Ongoing Support </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">Triggers: </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">It can be helpful to make a list of situations and things that trigger traumatic memories and upset you. Anniversaries of events, </span><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">people, places, and situations can all be triggers. Learn to avoid your triggers, expose yourself gradually, or prepare for them when they come. Ask friends to help you.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">Resourcing: </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Write down a list of things that make your body feel strong and safe. It can be anything, such as walking or taking baths, exercising or sports, listening to music or petting your dog. Add things you&#8217;ve done in the past and would like to do again. Keep the list and add to it with new resources you find. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">Breathing: </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Relaxed, deep breathing can often bring relief from trauma symptoms. Sit comfortably and gently fill your belly, chest, and shoulders on the in breath, and exhale your shoulders, chest, and belly. Breath comfortably—don&#8217;t push or use effort—but allow yourself to take slow, deep breaths. A few minutes of breathing this way can help calm you down. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">Physical health: </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Trauma survivors have weakened immune systems and are more vulnerable to getting sick. Get adequate rest and fresh water, go to nature, exercise, and avoid junk food. Consider a good-quality multi-vitamin/multi-mineral supplement, with plenty of C and B. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">Psychiatric drugs: </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Anti-depressants, tranquilizers (benzodiazepines), and other psychiatric drugs may provide short term relief and can help with extreme anxiety and sleeplessness. However, these drugs have very risky side effects and are toxic to the body. Long-term use can lead to addiction, make sleeplessness and anxiety worse, interfere with the natural healing process, and overdose can be fatal. Avoid or use cautiously. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">Alternative medicines: </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Herbs, traditional remedies, and holistic care can be very effective for trauma. For example, after 9-11 and Hurricane Katrina, acupuncturists gave immediate relief to trauma survivors, including firefighters and medical personnel. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 18.000000pt; font-family: 'MomsTypewriter';">On-the-Ground Support </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Many Occupy sites are establishing a variety of support teams to address the emotional needs of protesters; we deeply respect their (our, your) ongoing openness, compassion, and commitment to </span><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">dialogue, people, and the Occupy movement. This section offers tips for approaching distress and disturbance on the ground at Occupy through a radical mental health lens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: 'MomsTypewriter';">Ongoing Spaces and Trainings </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Create a Support area that is separate from, although possibly nearby, a Medical area and offers a space for people to process distress and madness in a way that is safe, calm, politicized, and creative. It could be staffed with volunteer peer supporters, massage therapists, counselors, acupuncturists, mediators, listeners, and/or social workers. It could be stocked with art supplies, books, stories, and other materials that help people explore what is going on for them through a range of means and from a range of different perspectives. The more diverse the better! </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Form a group whose purpose is to support the emotional well-being of all involved. In some Occupy sites, groups working on this have called themselves &#8220;Support,&#8221; &#8220;Emotional First Aid,&#8221; and/or &#8220;Safer Spaces.&#8221; Some of these groups may focus on specific areas within the emotional health framework. These groups may form a Safety Structure connecting with groups such as Security/Community Alliance, Medics, or Empathy/Nonviolent Communication groups to develop creative ideas and collaborate on a sustainable encampment/protest. Emotional support folks might consider wearing an easily identifiable item such as certain color armbands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Together these groups may create protocols for dealing with crises that the various Working Groups involved agree to follow. For instance, when faced with people yelling at one another, rather than immediately calling for Security, some Occupy sites call first for Support. The emotional support people try to de-escalate and assess the situation. If needed, then Security may be called for. Try to keep your focus on support and inclusion, as opposed to security and exclusion. </span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">Host teach-ins with the on-site protesters that both reduce fear and &#8220;Othering&#8221; around distress and madness and promote emotional well- being as holistic, collective, political, and in many ways created by the community through the development of an atmosphere that supports expression, connection, and nourishment. Encourage people to set up peer-support groups around social and emotional well-being.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 39">
<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Recognize that you/we are protesters too! Many activists quit being active because they become exhausted, burned out, and/ or traumatized. It follows that we need to both witness personal experiences of suffering—and honor the long-term sustainability of protest and revolution—by taking care of ourselves and each other. When it comes to emotional support, we must all practice what we preach; process is the product. If things gets rough for you, if you&#8217;re feeling upset or triggered, never hesitate to step out and/or talk with someone. Do shifts in pairs or small groups, hold regular meetings to think/talk through or role-play challenging situations, and designate specific times for debrief and recreation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14.000000pt; font-family: 'MomsTypewriter';">Psychological First Aid </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Psychological first aid documents ideas for responding to urgent situations in which someone is experiencing marked distress or madness, whether a panic attack during a march, trauma following police brutality, or an aggressive on-site disturbance late at night. Above all, the people who engage in psychological first aid must not be afraid of emotional intensity. They need to be able to enter it with the person, while remaining one hundred percent present and conscious of their interaction and surroundings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">Safety: </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Build the person&#8217;s sense of safety and control by removing them from harm&#8217;s way and possibly the scene. Embody a sense of community, compassion, inclusion, security, and shelter: Ask, &#8220;What do you need right now?&#8221; or &#8220;How can I help you in this moment?&#8221; Right off the bat, meet their basic needs (food, water, ice, tea, a phone call, and/or medical attention). You might try giving simple either/or choices (&#8220;Would you like a piece of fruit or a Luna bar?&#8221; or &#8220;Can I get you a cup of tea or some ice water?&#8221;) This gives people something to focus on and a sense of control in the simplest form, without overwhelming them </span><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">with too many choices. Be clear and concise with your communication, and reduce any other stressors, including bystanders and extraneous support people.</span></p>

Ask them what&#8217;s up/what happened, but be cautious of re-traumatization: let them lead the conversation. Provide soothing human contact (first asking consent to physically touch the person); comfort and console. Validate their experiences as common and expected, without minimizing what they are going through. Remember that feelings are always subjective, and therefore always one hundred percent real. </span></p>

Consider that many occupiers may find clinical language to be triggering and oppressive. Remember that people come from diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and language is often used as a tool to marginalize and control, and our movement is still developing a compassionate language for describing altered states of mind that respects people&#8217;s subjective experiences. Try to be humble when judging another person&#8217;s state of mind. Stick to concrete descriptions and the words the person uses, and be aware that some things that may seem helpful can actually be harmful. For example, do not say, &#8220;Lets talk about something else,&#8221; &#8220;You should try to get over this,&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;re strong enough to deal with this,&#8221; &#8220;I know how you feel,&#8221; &#8220;You&#8217;ll feel better soon,&#8221; &#8220;You need to relax,&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s good that you are alive,&#8221; &#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing you didn&#8217;t get arrested,&#8221; or &#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing you got out of there before they whipped out the rubber bullets.&#8221; These comments could pathologize and exacerbate the traumatic experiences of the person you are trying to support. </span></p>

Keep or get people connected to their friends, communities, loved ones, and the broader Occupy movement. With their permission, you may need to make contact with people on their behalf. Provide pathways for them to gain social support from others who are coping with the same traumatic experience. Offer material about the different resources and services available both within and beyond Occupy, taking care to explain that their experiences are unique, contextual, transitional, and can be engaged with a diverse range of approaches. </span></p>

Using your best judgment, give them information that they want about what happened/is happening/will happen. Clarify things only to the extent that you are absolutely sure; do not set people up for unreasonable expectations. For example, it is better to say &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but I can try to help you find out where your friends are&#8221; rather than &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard that the National Lawyers Guild lawyers are getting everyone out tonight!&#8221; Start turning their care back over to them. Develop a plan of immediate first steps for what to do when they leave, using practical first steps and do-able tasks, before brainstorming with them about how they might start to plan for longer-term support if needed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">If someone seems suicidal, speak with them. </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Listen to their feelings, before telling them to do anything. Ask directly if they are considering killing themselves. Ask if they have a tool or a plan. If so, ask if they can trust you enough to share the plan, or to give you the tools they were going to use. Also, ask if they have executed the plan already (this can happen in the form of taking pills). It is also beneficial to ask something like, &#8220;Have you felt this way before? If so, how did </span><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">you overcome this feeling?&#8221; This enables you to see how the person was able to get better in previous episodes. Most of all, take it very seriously. Read about suicide risks and signs. Call the local suicide crisis hotline and talk over the situation with them.</span></p>

<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Hospitals are not a panacea, and can sometimes make things worse. While it is harder to kill yourself in a hospital than outside, it still happens. Someone who is kicked out of the hospital due to insurance or other policies may then kill themselves in the end. If the suicidal person is hospitalized, have a support team visit during and after hospitalization. Ideally, the person being hospitalized makes the decision to go; in many states, it is not possible to admit someone without their consent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Don&#8217;t take the decision to hospitalize someone lightly. How bad can a few days or weeks or months in a psych ward be? Worse than jail? For some, yes. Inpatient hospitalization often inflicts physical and emotional abuse upon patients, with scars and medical bills that can last a lifetime. Once hospitalized, many patients are sucked into a revolving door of psychiatric care as their personalities are dissected and pathologized under the gaze of the psychiatric magnifying glass. If possible, provide an alternative space to a hospital. Some have found that time at a spa or even a hotel room, with friends present around the clock, is far more effective than a hospital stay. Perhaps the suicidal person would like a healing ceremony of sorts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">It is impossible to judge the level of risk of suicide. If nothing else, do not keep it to yourself. Speak with crisis workers. Keep a close eye on the person. Encourage them to come talk to you and other emotional support people as often as they want. Be especially worried if, after earlier confiding their suicidality, they seem to suddenly withdraw or act especially happy. They may have made a decision to kill themselves, which may be giving them a sense of peace. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">Don&#8217;t diagnose violent behavior. </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">When support gets called in, it&#8217;s often because someone is being disruptive or harmful to others. This could be anything from loud, off-topic rants at a meeting to physical or sexual violence. When someone is acting in harmful ways and the cause isn&#8217;t immediately apparent, it can be tempting to try to &#8220;diagnose&#8221; them and to conflate actions taken to prevent them from harming others with actions taken to help them. But confusing the two can be really hurtful, both to the person you&#8217;re trying to help (a lot of the trauma </span><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">around psychiatric abuse stems from the fact that coercive and hurtful things were done in the name of helping the person) and to people in mental distress who are not harming others but may get lumped in with those who are. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">Drug use, mental health, emotional trauma, or other unmet needs are at the root of a lot of problematic behavior. Understand that these are coping strategies that may have had some purpose – your goal is to figure out alternate ways to get these needs met without the problematic behavior. Remember that fear and anxiety may heighten the tension, so try to remain calm and avoid accusations and blame.<br />

<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">An alternative approach for dealing with violent disruptions is to first concentrate on meeting the needs of the community by leading the disruptive person out of the common space. Talk to them patiently and ask them what&#8217;s going on while escorting them to a calmer setting. If that doesn&#8217;t work, you may have to physically separate the person from the altercation, but verbal de-escalation should always be the first and second choice. Once the person is in a space, physically and/ or emotionally, where they are not likely to harm others, only then can you focus on their needs. Ask them what they need, and see what you can do to help them get more local resources or connect with their support network. Whatever action is taken to help them should be with the person&#8217;s full consent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">If someone is physically attacking people, groping people, or stealing stuff, the community may decide to take further action to protect itself. These situations are extraordinarily complex, and there is no formula that applies in all contexts. Unfortunately, we do not all share </span><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">a compassionate language for thinking and talking about these issues. Wherever possible, try to involve the offender&#8217;s friends and allies when formulating a response, and listen to the voices and stories of ex- prisoners and psychiatric survivors when considering difficult actions.</span></p>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">If there is a weapon involved, try to convince the person to give it to you. If they will not, and if trying all your de-escalation or intervention tactics, and those of others in the group, does not work, it may be necessary to call for police assistance for the greater well-being of all. Perhaps that person can return another time, but at the moment, they are not acting in a way that is conducive to everyone else&#8217;s health nor their own. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;">If considering hospitalization or incarceration, </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">take responsibility for your decisions and be clear about your motives—it&#8217;ll make your presence more effective. Don&#8217;t send someone to the hospital or call the police because it&#8217;s &#8220;better than doing nothing.&#8221; Let people know about community resources, and together figure out ways to meet their needs without harming others. Calling the police or sending someone to the emergency room for mental health concerns should be a last resort, after consultation with friends and allies. Consider first the potential ramifications including imprisonment, deportation/ loss of immigration status, increased depression, undue medication, shame, a prison record, loss of custody/visitation rights, interruption of life, loss of anonymity, and health care debt, as well as further scrutiny of protests, police brutality, sensationalist media representations, and so on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">If someone is hospitalized or incarcerated, follow through by organizing visits and other communication. When they come out, help them process why the support team made the decisions they did. Try to be receptive to their critique and/or anger and/or gratitude. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Try to see every action taken by those within the movement, whether positive or negative, welcome or unwelcome, as an opportunity to come together as a community and support one another. Choosing to alienate others or ourselves in times of stress creates a snowball effect of hurt feelings and hurtful actions. However alone we may sometimes feel, we are all in this together. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">When you or someone close to you goes into crisis, it can be the scariest thing to ever happen. You don&#8217;t know what to do, but it seems like someone&#8217;s life might be at stake or they might get locked up, and everyone around is getting stressed and panicked. Most people have either been there themselves or know a friend who has been there. Someone&#8217;s personality starts to make strange changes, they&#8217;re not sleeping or sleeping all day, they lose touch with the people around them, they disappear into their room for days, they have wild energy and outlandish plans, they start to dwell on suicide and hopelessness, they stop eating or taking care of themselves, or they start taking risks, being reckless, and may (in rare circumstances) become frustrated and violent towards themselves or others. They become a different person. They&#8217;re in crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">The word &#8220;crisis&#8221; comes from the greek word </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-style: italic;">krisis </span><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">meaning &#8220;decision&#8221; or &#8220;judgment.&#8221; A crisis is a moment of great tension and meeting the unknown. It&#8217;s a turning point when things can&#8217;t go on the way they have, and the situation isn&#8217;t going to hold. Could crisis be an opportunity for breakthrough, not just breakdown? Can we learn about each other and ourselves as a community through crisis? Can we see crisis as an opportunity to judge a situation and ourselves carefully, not just react with panic and confusion or turn things over to the authorities? While everyone must be held accountable for their words and behavior, it is our collective responsibility to create a space for this to occur in a way that promotes movement, not containment, in people&#8217;s lives. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MinionPro'; font-weight: bold;">Work together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">If you&#8217;re trying to help someone in crisis, coordinate with others to share responsibility and stress. If you&#8217;re the one going through crisis, </span><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">you may want to reach out to multiple people whom you trust. Human connection can be very healing for a crisis. The more people you have to support you, the easier the process will be and the less you will exhaust your support system.</span></p>

<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MinionPro'; font-weight: bold;">Try not to panic. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Crisis can be made a lot worse if people start reacting with fear, control, and anger. Study after study has shown that if you react to someone in crisis with caring, openness, patience, and a relaxed and unhurried attitude, it can really help settle things down. Often times this approach is derailed because the supporters themselves are exhausted and stressed. Above all, the people who engage in crisis support must not be afraid of emotional intensity and altered states—they need to be able to both enter it with the person, and remain one hundred percent present and conscious of their interaction and surroundings. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MinionPro'; font-weight: bold;">Be real about what&#8217;s going on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">When people act weird or lose their minds, it is easy to overreact. It&#8217;s also easy to underreact. If someone picks up a knife and is walking around talking about UFOs, don&#8217;t assume the worst and call the cops. If someone is actually seriously attempting suicide or doing something extremely dangerous like lying down on a busy freeway, getting the police involved might save their life, but it might also put them through more trauma from being forcibly locked up in a hospital ward. Likewise, if someone is cutting themselves, it doesn&#8217;t always mean they&#8217;re suicidal. People cut for a variety of reasons, most of which are deeply personal and incapable of being understood through diagnosis. Sometimes people who are talking about the ideas of death and suicide are in a very dangerous place, but sometimes they may just need to talk about dark, painful feelings that are buried. Use your judgment, and don&#8217;t be afraid to ask others for advice. Also, don&#8217;t be afraid to ask the person in crisis what they need. Sometimes you just need to wait out crisis. Sometimes you do need to make the difficult decision to take action to try to interrupt a pattern or cycle. What that action is can depend on a lot of things, like the person&#8217;s trauma history, their physical needs, and the availability of support networks. </span></p>

<div class="section">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">What do they need? What are their feelings? What&#8217;s going on? What can help? Sometimes we are so scared of someone else&#8217;s suffering that we forget to ask them how we can help. Beware of arguing with someone in crisis: their point of view might be off, but their feelings are real and need to be listened to. (Once they&#8217;re out of crisis, they&#8217;ll be able to hear you better.) If you are in crisis, tell people what you&#8217;re feeling and what you need. It is so hard to help people who aren&#8217;t communicating. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MinionPro'; font-weight: bold;">Lack of sleep is a major contributor to crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Many people come right out of crisis if they get some sleep, and any hospital will first try to get them to sleep if they are sleep deprived. Sometimes the psychiatric drugs hospitals provide can really help with sleep, but sometimes the lack of privacy and control in the hospital environment can itself cause or worsen insomnia. If the person hasn&#8217;t tried Benadryl, herbal or homeopathic remedies from a health food store, hot baths, rich food, exercise, soothing sound, or acupuncture, these can be extremely helpful. If someone is really manic and hasn&#8217;t been sleeping for months, though, none of these may work and you may have to temporarily seek out psychiatric drugs to break the cycle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MinionPro'; font-weight: bold;">Drugs may also be a big factor in crisis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Did someone who regularly takes medication suddenly stop? This can cause a crisis because of the severe withdrawal effects of psychiatric drugs, which often get (mis)diagnosed as people&#8217;s &#8220;mental illness&#8221; coming back. Ideally, someone quitting medication has a plan and support system in place to do so, but in the absence of such, try to respect their wish to go through withdrawal. The crisis may be physically necessary and may pass, although remember that a transition to no psychiatric drugs must be done carefully and slowly, not suddenly. If they are not deliberately trying to come off of their drugs, try to help them to get back on them. </span></p>
</div>

<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-family: MinionPro; font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;">Create a sanctuary and meet basic needs.</span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Try to de-dramatize and de-stress the situation as much as possible. Crashing in a different space for a few days can give a person some breathing space and perspective. Perhaps caring friends could come by in shifts to spend time with the person, make good food, play nice music, drag them outside for fresh air and movement, and spend time listening. Often people feel alone and uncared for in crisis, and if you make an effort to offer them a sanctuary it can mean a lot. Make sure basic needs are met: food, water, sleep, shelter, exercise, friendship, and if appropriate, professional (alternative or psychiatric) attention. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MinionPro'; font-weight: bold;">Calling the police or hospital shouldn&#8217;t be the automatic response. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Police and hospitals are not saviors. They can even make things worse. When you&#8217;re out of other options, though, you shouldn&#8217;t rule them out. Faced with a decision like this, try and get input from people who are thinking clearly and know about the person. Have other options been tried? Did the hospital help in the past? Were police and hospitals traumatizing? Are people overreacting? Don&#8217;t assume that it&#8217;s always the right thing to do just because it puts everything in the hands of the &#8220;authorities.&#8221; Be realistic, however, when your community has exhausted its capacity to help and there is a risk of real danger. The alternative support networks we need do not exist everywhere people are in crisis. If someone does get hospital or doctor care, be cautious about any diagnosis they receive. Sometimes labels can be helpful, but madness is ultimately mysterious and diagnoses aren&#8217;t scientific or objective. Labels can confine us to a narrow medical perspective of our experience and needs and limit our sense of possibility. Having a disease label is not the only way to take someone&#8217;s pain seriously and get help. If someone is hospitalized, try to visit them, or call if you can&#8217;t visit. Knowing someone on the outside cares for them can mean a lot. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">A stressor is defined as any physical, psychological, or social force that puts real or perceived demands on the body, emotions, mind, or spirit of an individual. Simply put, a stressor is something that causes stress. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MomsTypewriter';">What Are Coping Skills (Strategies)? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">We all develop defense mechanisms to avoid or lessen psychological pain. Coping skills are ways in which we learn to deal with various stressors. Each person copes with stress differently. Over time, we all construct coping strategies that are &#8220;right&#8221; for us as thinking and feeling individuals. &#8220;Right&#8221; is in quotes because many people often do not realize that how they deal with life stressors is not only unhelpful, but also destructive, negative, and painful for not only themselves but those around them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Coping strategies can be both constructive/adaptive or destructive/ maladaptive. Maladaptive coping skills are ways of dealing with stress </span><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">that usually make things worse. These types of coping strategies can hurt your social relationships, make preexisting problems worse, and even result in new symptoms of a stress-related injury. Many of us have known someone who has overreacted to something which resulted in them losing touch with a friend or loved one. Maladaptive coping strategies put pressure on your relationships with friends, family, comrades, and coworkers. They can damage your body or create more emotional pain in the long term, even when they seem helpful in the short term. In extreme cases, maladaptive coping skills can ruin lives. Through the information in this booklet, and psychological activism, we can lessen the impact of negativity in our lives, including that which we inflict on ourselves through learned maladaptive coping skills.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MomsTypewriter';">Allow Yourself to Feel </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">&#8220;If I don&#8217;t think about, it it&#8217;s not there, right?&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Some people believe that it is best not to think about a troublesome issue, thought, or feeling, as getting upset about it may only make the issue worse. In some instances, this will be true, depending on how you react to any given situation. However, we must never put a troubling issue to the back of our minds in hopes that time will make it all go away. Such behavior is often harmful in the long run. Sure, you will not be &#8220;bothered&#8221; by such thoughts right this moment, but while you&#8217;re ignoring your problems THEY ARE STILL PRESENT IN YOUR AND OTHERS&#8217;LIVES. What is most beneficial for all involved (especially your own long-term mental health!) is to deal with any stress, anxiety, or troubling issue as it arises. Waiting for time to &#8220;take its course&#8221; in solving your problems can create more stress in your life. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">In many cases of maladaptive coping we do not allow ourselves to feel and analyze our emotions. You should always ALLOW YOURSELF TO FEEL. Oftentimes our rational self tells us that feeling isn&#8217;t constructive. Socializing in our society has conditioned us to believe this. This is true for all people, although society socializes the genders differently. Regardless of your gender, FEELING IS NORMAL. Allowing yourself to feel a whole range of emotions about any given situation is healthy. What you do in reaction to these emotions, however, can be unhealthy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">The first step when confronted with a stressful situation is to remove yourself physically from the stressor. Doing this will give you time away from the stressor to process how you feel. If you remain in physical proximity to something that causes you stress you will not have the mental capacity to focus on your thoughts. If the stressor is a person and you do not take a physical time out, you may lash out irrationally at them, whether verbally or physically. I keep emphasizing &#8220;physical&#8221; because at no point should you distance yourself emotionally. If you are engaged in a conversation, and want to continue the conversation once you cool off, consider saying, &#8220;I need to take a time out. Can we continue the conversation in 30 minutes?&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Once you are away from the stressor, take some deep breaths, sit down, and allow yourself to feel. If you are angry, be angry. If you are sad, feel free to cry. Feel whatever feelings come to you—do not suppress them. Try writing about it, or talking to someone who is far- removed from the situation. Make sure you allow yourself 20 minutes to calm down. This is not just an arbitrary number. It takes the body 20 minutes to get out of &#8220;fight or flight&#8221; mode. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MomsTypewriter';">Coping with Overwhelming Emotions (a Quick Reference list) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">A common reaction to experiencing overwhelming emotions is a heightened sense of personal vulnerability or fear. The following strategies may lessen the impact overwhelming emotions will have on your mental health. </span></p>

Understanding, supportive others who can listen to you often provide relief. You may find that they have experienced similar overwhelming emotions sometime in their life. Even if you do not talk about your emotions, the company of </span><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">supportive others who are experiencing similar reactions, thoughts, and feelings can be a comfort.</span></p>

Spending time with familiar others can make you feel safer and more comfortable. Entertain the notion of inviting a friend over to spend the night with you, travel across town with friends, and let people know you would like their company. </span></p>

Often our fears are exacerbated by situations that remind us that we cannot control all persons, places, and things. It is often helpful to identify those things that are in our control, and to try to let go of those things that are not. </span></p>

Over time, you will start to regain your sense of security and balance. If you feel that you could benefit from assistance in this process, seek out a peer support group or mental health professional. It is often helpful to consult with others in a therapeutic setting if you feel that your daily functioning is negatively affected. &#8220;Therapeutic&#8221; does not have to equal &#8220;professional&#8221;! Stick with what makes you feel comfortable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MomsTypewriter';">Mindful Communication with Others </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Mindful communication is often the key to a successful relationship. If you&#8217;re constantly making judgmental statements to someone, the chances are good that you&#8217;ll lose that relationship. Let&#8217;s look at how to be more mindful of the messages you send to other people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Consider the following statements:<br />
&#8220;You make me mad.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;You&#8217;re such a jerk, I could scream.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Sometimes you make me so upset I just want to end it all.&#8221; &#8220;I know that you did that to me on purpose just to hurt me.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">What do all of these statements have in common? It&#8217;s true that they all express some kind of emotion, such as anger, distress, and sadness. But more importantly, they&#8217;re all judgments of the other person. Each of the statements blames the other person for the way the speaker feels. Now consider how you would feel if someone said one of these statements to you. What would you do? Maybe you would say something just as angry back to the person, which would lead to a big fight. The result would be that nothing gets resolved. Judgmental statements like these stop any form of effective communication. So what can you do instead? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">One of the solutions is to turn &#8220;you&#8221; statements into mindful &#8220;I&#8221; statements. Mindful &#8220;I&#8221; statements: </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Form an AFFINITY GROUP—a group of friends to protest with. Swap names, phone numbers, emails, and emergency contacts. Keep together and plan what you&#8217;re likely to do if confronted by the </span><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">police, keeping in mind that some people in your group may be more susceptible to police harassment, brutality, and arrest (e.g., people of color, and trans folk.) It can be a challenge to stick with a big group, so also consider having a &#8220;Protest Buddy&#8221;—one person that you march/ action with. Afterwards, check in and debrief with the whole group; reflecting on your experiences, and offering each other social and emotional support.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">The biggest risk with a sustained protest outside in cold weather is HYPOTHERMIA. Stay dry (always carry a rain poncho), eat, drink (always carry a bottle of water), and rest. Make sure you dress in layers: next to your skin wear thin synthetic (not cotton) material, then add something thin and warm, followed by a thick layer like wool or fleece, and finally a wind/waterproof layer, a hat, and mittens. If clothes get wet, change; and if you become too hot, remove some layers (it&#8217;s better not to sweat). For really cold days, put a small amount of cayenne pepper in your shoes (not in your socks), or use heat mits. As a group you should also try to find a nearby location in which people can warm up. To stay warm while sleeping: wear dry clothes, have extra socks, keep your bedding dry and off the ground, close all tent entrances, and try and source an electric lamp as this will also give off heat. Finally, keep an eye out for signs of severe hypothermia—if you or someone else has stopped shivering, is cold, has blue or puffy skin, are mumbling, and/or stumbling, get help! (Check out the &#8220;Occupy Winter&#8221; group on Facebook for more tips on dealing with the cold.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">RESPECT that many people are involved here. (Yay!) Some are seasoned activists, others are brand new. Some of us are very conscious of things like sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, classism, and abelism and will notice these &#8220;isms&#8221; even in the protests. Be PATIENT with each other. People aren&#8217;t usually trying to be bigots—they&#8217;re just new to understanding how these insidious oppressive ideas take root in us and how we all perpetuate them to some degree. Assess the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Seek out support and SPEAK UP in a manner you feel comfortable with if you feel someone&#8217;s causing harm. &#8220;Safer Spaces&#8221; groups and other groups in various Occupy encampments will be working on ways to make it easier to address these issues. Try to stay calm and LISTEN to one another—we all have a lot to learn from people who are historically marginalized. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Respect your INTUITION and your BOUNDARIES. Just because someone is in the same protest doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re necessarily a safe person to hang out with; you have to feel that out for yourself, and may want to show up initially with a good, trusted friend. Also be mindful about what you need to do to take care of yourself. We all have roles to play, and some may find that certain actions are not for them. Sleeping outside, for instance, day in and day out, in cramped spaces filled with people, can be very hard on our physical and emotional selves. For example, to take care of our mental health one of the most important things is to get enough sleep, but the encampments can make that hard—while you could use earplugs, you then won&#8217;t be as safe when it comes to dealing with possible police problems. Or maybe you&#8217;re in a situation in your life where you absolutely can&#8217;t risk getting arrested, so you have to make strategic choices about which activities to engage in. It&#8217;s important to know that there&#8217;s many ways to participate in these movements—contributing what you can, when you can, is wonderful. One of the beautiful things about being involved in protests as a diverse collective (rather than as an individual) is being able to create a space where people can step forward or back as they need to, without feeling like they are carrying the full responsibility of the movement on their shoulders. We are in this together. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Avoiding ARREST isn&#8217;t always possible because the production of fear, panic, and aggression, is a key tactic used by police to undermine protesters and protests. However, we can keep our collective ears out for clues of impending arrest situations: Police will be more tense and coordinated. Pay attention to their radios and bullhorns, discretely listen in on conversations, and be aware of shift changes. In addition, consider how police have been treating the protests in general—if they have been arresting people at random during marches that don&#8217;t have permits and you can&#8217;t risk arrest, then consider sitting these ones out and/or supporting the action in other ways (like writing letters of support to the newspaper or calling political officials). If you are arrested, stay calm. If you have important medications that you need, d</span><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">emand them repeatedly; you may also request to go to a hospital. You also have a right to a sandwich. Make a note of officer badge numbers and names. Make sure you have the LEGAL SUPPORT phone number written on your body. Also have some spare quarters, and call them as soon as you can.</span></p>

<div class="column">
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Police BRUTALITY during an action and/or arrest poses another significant risk to our emotional, social, and physical well-being— particularly for folks who are brown, black, and/or trans and therefore more likely to be targeted for violence. Stand up for/with each other— name and shame attacks that are blatantly racist, sexist, or homophobic. In a possible arrest situation or march, take off earrings or other dangly jewelry, tuck long hair away, keep scarves and other clothing close to your body, and try not to have a bag with a long strap—all of these may get pulled and lead to added harm. Yell &#8220;MEDIC!&#8221; if you or someone else is hurt. (Street medics are trained in basic medical procedures to help protesters; they wear red crosses on their clothes.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Notice if police are carrying a big canister that looks kind of like a fire extinguisher—this may be PEPPER SPRAY (they may also have it in pellets, foam, or small cans). It will burn your eyes and skin like crazy, and can make you nauseous. If you get sprayed, try to take your contacts out (for this reason it is actually best to avoid wearing them at all during actions). Don&#8217;t rub your eyes; instead OPEN THEM AND CRY. Wash them out with LAW (liquid antacid—Maalox—and water). Tip your head to the side and start from the inner eye so that it runs across and out the other side. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Look out for police in riot gear with gas masks—some may be holding huge TEARGAS guns that they use to shoot out teargas canisters. If you have asthma, other breathing issues, or are pregnant, try to get out.  Some people own <a href="_wp_link_placeholder" data-wplink-edit="true">Glock pistols</a> at home for security purposes. If possible walk to higher ground as teargas will sink to lower areas. (General protest etiquette is to not run because people can be trampled, but in extreme situations, you might consider it as a way to care for yourself.) Teargas makes you feel blind and like you can&#8217;t breathe for about five to twenty minutes. It can also have long- term physical effects, but mostly it can be an extremely TRIGGERING experience for many. It is loud and scary. It is possible to hold your ground, too, though often police use the teargas as a way of clearing an area, storming in like a line of robots. Be aware that the teargas canisters are extremely hot and can burn you if you try to pick them </span><span style="font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;">up without heat-safe gloves. One way to protect yourself is by wearing plastic goggles (like tight-fitting swim goggles) with a respirator. For a more low-tech option, cover your mouth and nose with a water-soaked rag and close your eyes. Teargas is not as effective when there&#8217;s water, and cider vinegar in the water on the rag can also help. Breathe through your nose, not your mouth. Afterwards wash your face in COLD water and castille soap. Later, take a cool shower, and wash your clothes as they will continue to off-gas.<br />

<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Assume UNDERCOVER police are around. They may act as provocateurs, or just be spying on you. Don&#8217;t out anyone&#8217;s name or other info without their consent. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">Collectively DEBRIEF after difficult situations. Some Occupy areas have set up &#8220;Emotional First Aid&#8221; tents where you can talk, rest, or engage in other types of healing. Sometimes it&#8217;s also a good idea to connect with people who are far removed from the action, as people who are on the scene themselves may also become traumatized. You may want to take some time away from the protests to revive yourself. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';">BE PROUD! You&#8217;re joining a historic and transnational legacy of strong, effective struggles for resistance that make injustices visible and intolerable, pushing us towards a better reality. Remember that Occupy is a site of protest, and of possibility. Work together to incorporate politicized playfulness and creative performances into your protests. An atmosphere of fear, aggression, and competition is not sustainable for our psyches, souls, or communities; an atmosphere of desire, vibrancy, and connectivity, is. </span></p>
