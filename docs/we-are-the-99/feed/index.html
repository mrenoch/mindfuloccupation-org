					<description><![CDATA[I am university qualified and have experience in multiple industries. I have survived rape, emotional abuse and threats to my life since my infancy. I even managed to survive the mental illness due to luck and my own hard work when I was put on anti-psychotics for years.  Eventually, even though I had no attention span, no government or family income support, and only ate twice per week until I got a part time job (that lasted more than two weeks) which I barely kept while I was still being traumatised at home and by my past, I got to the final year of my degree. I finally left an abusive situation, only to rent a property where the landlord had been dead for a year and the estate agent decided that they wouldn&#039;t tell me about it. I spent the term of my lease fending off banks and government departments as they fussed around over probate and who was supposed to pay the mortgage - me, it seems.  I then spent a year in court, lost my job, the chance of doing post grad (and therefore becoming fully employable in my field) and all my work was in vain.  The court decided I had no right to disclosure and took most of my bond, and I didn&#039;t have enough money to even apply for appeal, and even so called legal aid wouldn&#039;t represent me.  I&#039;m not on the streets now is because our government paid stimulus packages right when I needed a bond, and because I managed to (finally) get some government benefits, and someone to share my rent with.  We barely survive in this situation. My depression continues to deepen, and we cannot escape it.  I have been saving for the last few years to see a counsellor and although I probably need therapy every week,  I&#039;m probably going to get it twice before I have to quit it, yet again.  This is even if our government keeps the so called &#039;better access&#039; rebate.  In short, I am unemployed and sick because of other people - including government departments.  Corporations and the state are directly involved in my exploitation and suffering.  

Occupy - simply knowing you exist is keeping me alive at the moment. Thank you!

&quot;I am reacting naturally to an unnatural situation&quot;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So many of us are struggling yet those in power continue not to listen. I wish Americans could come together and support each other, but mostly what I see in my own life is a dog-eat-dog philosophy. Everyone thinks they&#039;re going to &quot;make it&quot; someday and if you&#039;re struggling it must be your fault. I don&#039;t have a picture but I do have a video of my own situation here:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHCtlOvzAxU&#038;feature=channel_video_title

I make videos and started a podcast supporting the occupy movement, but I&#039;m still just a paycheck away from being homeless. Sadly, I don&#039;t have it in me to commit suicide, so all that&#039;s left is to get politically active. 

I truly believe there is a conspiracy taking place. Our politicians know we are suffering, but they just don&#039;t care. They only care about their corporate constituents.]]></description>
