No one in the group is above anyone else: mutual aid means we listen to and support each other as a community of equals, without paid professionals or staff to define who we are. Each of us is an expert on our own experience, and each of us is the center for our decisions\u2014 and we are not alone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">When we gather together with people who&#8217;ve been through what we&#8217;ve been through, people who share some of the mysteries and suffering that get labeled &#8220;mental illness,&#8221; we discover new maps through crisis, learn new tools to stay healthy, and weave communities of solidarity to change the world. We discover something at the heart of the dangerous gift of madness: caring for others is often the best way to care for ourselves. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MomsTypewriter';\">Listening Spaces <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">There is a wide diversity of group models to draw on, and we encourage you to experiment to find the best fit for you. All these approaches, however, share the same essential principle: create a space for listening. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">In nature, stillness, silence, and sky create a vast container for what is essential to emerge. Step into wilderness and you encounter a hushed patience and gentle holding rare in the noisy, sped-up clash and clamor of our lives. Corporate monocropped culture suppresses true listening and imposes labels, rigid habits, and preconceived notions. Real support and caring means breaking down habitual ways of interacting, and meeting each other in spaces of true, effective listening.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 63\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MinionPro'; font-weight: bold;\">Key elements of listening spaces <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';\">= <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Don&#8217;t talk over others or interrupt.

Facilitators help the group listen more effectively, and pay specific attention to the overall needs and direction of everyone involved, not just their own individual needs. The facilitator should avoid bias, and if they are too involved with a particular group topic then someone else might be better in the role. It helps when two people facilitate and when facilitators reflect group diversity such as gender, age, and race. It is also good to pair more experienced and less experienced facilitators, and to offer new people a chance to learn facilitation skills. <\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;\">Importantly, everyone should keep overall group needs in mind, and everyone can assist the group through self-facilitation.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 64\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MinionPro'; font-weight: bold;\">Key elements of facilitation and self-facilitation <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';\">= <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Create a clear agenda or plan on how to spend your time together. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';\">= <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Keep track of time so people can &#8220;wrap up&#8221; their feelings without feeling cut off or not heard.

Suggest breaks, exercises, games, or agenda and time revisions when necessary. If conversation is lagging, ask questions, tell a story, or get up and do some stretching. Sometimes if the group is stuck, the facilitator can ask a clarifying question, reframe an issue, or connect points to earlier discussion. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';\">= <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Offer choices, especially if people want feedback or not after they speak. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';\">= <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Consider using &#8220;I&#8221; statements when speaking, such as &#8220;I feel&#8221; and &#8220;I want,&#8221; to stay focused on your own feelings and needs. Talking about other people or gossiping takes focus away from your own experience. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';\">= <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Encourage defining problems within the concept of &#8220;dangerous gifts&#8221; and unique mysterious talents rather than seeing ourselves as flawed or diseased. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';\">= <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Use a common vocabulary and minimize jargon.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\"><br \/> <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';\">= <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Be on the lookout for repeating patterns in each other&#8217;s lives to <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Candara; font-size: large;\">identify root causes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';\">= <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Investigate how past experiences shape present realities.

Nature isn&#8217;t always neat and orderly. Sometimes wild conversation, spontaneity, and &#8220;breaking all the rules of facillitation&#8221; is exactly what the group needs in the moment. A skilled facillitator and skilled participants can feel when the chaos and cacophany that erupt are refreshing and true to the group spirit, and when to go with it. Then comes the time to reel it all back in and return to the basic structure of taking turns and listening carefully. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MomsTypewriter';\">Inclusion and Self-Determination <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Groups need to be welcoming and inclusive, where diverse perspectives and life choices are respected and honored according to the principles of harm reduction and self-determination.

Once weekly, once a month? Is it a drop-in group, or are people committed for a series? Is it open to anyone or does the group select its members? Looking at and learning from different group models can give you a broader sense of what is possible and how to structure your group. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';\">= <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">12-Step Programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous.

Groups build trust when this vulnerability is respected and cared for. Your group should agree to a confidentiality policy and make sure to practice it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MinionPro'; font-weight: bold;\">Some options are <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">General Experience Only: <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Members may discuss what they and others say and do with people outside the group, but only generally, without any names, details, or clues about the specific people or events. This is a common policy, used in the NYC Icarus Group and Freedom Center: it supports discussion of sensitive topics such as abuse, criminal behavior, and suicide, while allowing participants to take what they learn to the rest of the world. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">Personal Experience Only: <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">&#8220;What&#8217;s said here stays here.&#8221; Participants may discuss what they themselves say and do with people outside the group, but may not talk about, or even refer generally, to what others say or do. This is a more restrictive policy used for groups, such as 12- step groups, that focus specifically on difficult topics such as addiction and abuse. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">Full Disclosure: <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Group participants are free to talk about anything that happened in the group. While common for activist organizations and public events that want to get the word out freely, this approach should be weighed carefully for groups providing mutual emotional support. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">Total Non-Disclosure: <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Anything said or done is not repeated, or even alluded to generally, to anyone outside the group. This can be useful <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;\">for a closed group focused on a very sensitive topic, where participants want to go very deeply into personal issues over time. This is a common policy used in the RVA Icarus Group.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 72\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Every group has different needs, so while General Experience Only is the most common support group policy, the group should set its own policy. Make sure to explain the confidentiality policy at the beginning of meetings, perhaps as part of the preamble. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MomsTypewriter';\">Example Peer Support Facilitator Notes <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Keep in mind that each group is different and unique and that it may be necessary to review and revise the format of your peer support group and the level of disclosure that is practiced. These are the notes that the facilitators of peer support groups in Richmond, Virginia&#8217;s Icarus Project group use during weekly peer support groups. Feel free to reuse and remix these notes, or make up your own entirely! <\/span><\/p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<li style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Start on time! <\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Choose a facilitator via consensus decision-making. <\/span><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">If someone is uncomfortable with the person offering to facilitate, that person needs to voice their position and put in a downvote.

Introductions: Facilitator explains the role of a facilitator. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">A facilitator guides the group process so that it flows smoothly. In this way, the facilitator leads the group efficiently, but does not take leadership responsibility. The facilitator makes sure that everyone has an equal amount of time to speak and that no person is speaking over or interrupting someone else. The facilitator also keeps time. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">As our group is non-hierarchical, we like to rotate the position of facilitator for each meeting. If you wish to volunteer to facilitate in the future, please raise your hand now or speak with me after the meeting. Inexperienced facilitators may be able to team up with more <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;\">experienced facilitators. Please do not hesitate to ask questions if you are unsure of what a facilitator does.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 73\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">4.

Facilitator explains the level of confidentiality that we consented to at the first meeting. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">We use general experience only: while in peer support, members may discuss what they and others say and do with people outside the group, but only generally, without using any names, details, or clues about the specific people or events. This supports discussion of sensitive topics such as abuse, criminal behavior, and suicide. This is helpful because many of us may frequent the same places or have the same friends. Someone said at the first meeting that &#8220;we do not have consent to use someone&#8217;s name that is not present.&#8221; <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">We also use total non-disclosure.

If the person is new to peer support, we suggest that they share how they&#8217;ve been doing recently (i.e. the past few weeks\/a month). The person sharing can voice whether they would like a response or if they just want people to listen, and would not like a response at this time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\"> <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;\">9.
