Anything that makes our body panic and go into a fight\/ flight\/freeze response can leave us traumatized. The effects may be immediate or take time to surface, and can be felt for the rest of our lives.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Being traumatized is a <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">normal response to an extreme situation; <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">even &#8220;tough&#8221; people like mothers or seasoned political activists can be traumatized. Emotional traumatization happens to everyone, no matter how &#8220;hardcore&#8221; they are. There is a tendency in activist circles for some folks to act heroic in the face of trauma. It is perfectly common, even expected, to respond to experiences of police violence and rough protest street scenes in extreme ways. There are professionals <a href=\"https:\/\/www.c2cfirstaidaquatics.com\/brampton\/\">based in Brampton, c2c offers first aid training<\/a> for people to be prepared during emergencies.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">According to<a href=\"https:\/\/www.cprcertificationchicago.com\/\"> Chicago CPR Training<\/a>, the causes of trauma can include almost anything: disaster, abuse, rape, witnessing violence, loss, or spending time with people who are traumatized. Because <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">trauma happens when our bodies perceive our lives are in danger and we can&#8217;t escape, <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">medical surgeries, emotional abuse, or loss of a loved one or home can also be traumatic. Even though two people may experience a similar event, one may feel traumatized by it, while the other does not. It is important not to judge others for their experience of trauma. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Trauma means getting <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">stuck in the memory <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">of a life- threatening event. Our bodies and minds act like the event is still happening, right now, even though it is in the past. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">We are on guard, defensive, and &#8220;geared up,&#8221; or hopeless, paralyzed, and numb. We avoid things that remind us of the past and trigger painful memories, and we isolate ourselves from others and limit our freedom. We block out unpleasant memories and feelings, sometimes turning to drugs and alcohol. We repeat past situations. We have panic attacks or go into jumpy &#8220;fight-flight&#8221; mode, even when there is no real danger in the present. Our lives, health, and relationships with other people suffer, and <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">we live constrained and limited by our past. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Sometimes we take our pain out on others, or become self-destructive. <\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;\">In the past these trauma responses were crucial to our survival, and in the present they protect us from being overwhelmed. When we value the usefulness of our trauma coping mechanisms, forgiveness and acceptance can invite gradual change.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 51\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Unfortunately <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">trauma is usually not a wound that heals just by waiting <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">for time to pass. Trauma can keep hold of our lives for many years. It is important to try to work with the trauma somehow, in whatever way is best for you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Making connections with others and honestly expressing our feelings is important, especially when we want to hide or avoid our problems. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">Finding safety and trust is the first step to healing. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Just talking, though, may not be enough to heal trauma. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">Sometimes talking about what happened can mean <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;\">reliving <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">what happened, <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">and not help. If the talking seems to go in circles or not lead to a sense of completion, it might be just stirring things up, not healing them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">It is also commonly believed that you can heal trauma by &#8220;getting it out of your system,&#8221; punching pillows, or venting strong emotions. This can be helpful, but sometimes it can end up making things worse, or even re-traumatize you. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">Real trauma healing is usually slower and more gentle. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Therapy, including EMDR, DBT, and CBT, can help many people. Others find these are not helpful. This section focuses on what we can do for each other as a community. Most importantly, <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">everyone is an individual\u2014experiment and discover what works for you <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">and learn how to best help yourself and others. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MinionPro'; font-weight: bold;\">Signs of a traumatized or &#8220;triggered&#8221; state: <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';\">= <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Repetitive thinking of worrying thoughts or memories related to the event; intrusive memories and feelings; chronic fear <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';\">= <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Staring off into space; &#8220;thousand yard stare;&#8221; flattened or frozen expression and body; freezing and numbing; &#8220;emptiness&#8221; <\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Candara;\">= <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;\">Extreme defensiveness and rigid thinking; irritability; explosive overreactions<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 52\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';\">= <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Sexual preoccupation and constant interest <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">= Discomfort, pain, stress, illness; &#8220;nerves&#8221; <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'SkitchOrnamentsFill';\">= <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Returning to traumatizing situations <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MinionPro'; font-weight: bold;\">When someone has just been traumatized: <\/span><\/p>\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: decimal;\">\n<li style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Help any bodily injury, medical issue, or physical need first <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Don&#8217;t get up and act like nothing happened <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Go to a safe place; help them to stay dry, warm, and still <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\"><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">If the person wants to talk, listen without interrupting or changing <\/span>the subject5. Remember that trembling or being emotional is part of healing, and better than &#8220;numbing out;&#8221; encourage people to feel the sensations in their body fully. (See below.)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MinionPro'; font-weight: bold;\">First Aid\/Feeling Body Sensations: <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Trauma cuts us off from our bodies. When we are in overwhelming danger, we dissociate or &#8220;leave our bodies&#8221; as a protective measure. Later this protective mechanism becomes stuck and counterproductive. The <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">key to healing trauma is to return to our bodies, <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">by feeling our physical sensations and making our bodies safe and alive again. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Ask, &#8220;How do you know that you are sad? Is there tightness in your chest or throat? How do you know you are afraid? Is there a cold feeling, or a sinking feeling in your stomach? Feel it fully. How large is the feeling? Is it changing? What do you feel next?&#8221; Listen without interruption and give plenty of time to feel and respond. Grounding and resourcing yourself will also help the other person.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 53\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Keeping eyes open usually is best for focusing on body sensations. <\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">If the person can&#8217;t feel their body at all, ask, &#8220;Can you feel your feet on the ground? Your pelvis sitting on the chair?&#8221; Grasp their hand or shoulder and say &#8220;Can you feel my hand?&#8221; <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">Always ask before touching. <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">If lying down, ask them to sit up. Ask to walk around slowly and feel their legs and feet. Or gently hold and press their feet to the ground. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">If the person is staring off in the distance, talking in circles, withdrawn, or agitated, encourage them to put their attention to the world. Ask, &#8220;Look around\u2014what colors do you see? Can you name them?&#8221; Ask them what sensations they feel in their bodies. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">When someone is preoccupied with traumatic memories, find distractions. Ask them, &#8220;When was a time that you felt safe and peaceful? Can you describe the sights, sounds, smells and colors of that time?&#8221; Ask them to feel sensations in their body. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">If the person is defensive, on guard and uncooperative, just drop it. Change the subject, go for a walk, leave the discussion\/work for later. When a traumatized and defensive person perceives you as a threat, it is very difficult to convince them to just &#8220;snap out of it&#8221; or to see that they are experiencing a flashback. Wait until they are calm to discuss it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">If body sensations are too uncomfortable, try to find a sensation, even small, that is neutral or pleasant, and focus on it. Go back and forth between uncomfortable and pleasant senations. Notice any relaxation in breathing, warmth, or trembling. This is normal; feel the sensations fully. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Feelings of fear, guilt, loss, sadness, or anger are normal when we are traumatized. Don&#8217;t judge feelings in yourself or others. Listen with acceptance and care. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.000000pt; font-family: 'MinionPro'; font-weight: bold;\">Ongoing Support <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">Triggers: <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">It can be helpful to make a list of situations and things that trigger traumatic memories and upset you. Anniversaries of events, <\/span><span style=\"font-family: Candara; font-size: 15px;\">people, places, and situations can all be triggers. Learn to avoid your triggers, expose yourself gradually, or prepare for them when they come. Ask friends to help you.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">Resourcing: <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Write down a list of things that make your body feel strong and safe. It can be anything, such as walking or taking baths, exercising or sports, listening to music or petting your dog. Add things you&#8217;ve done in the past and would like to do again. Keep the list and add to it with new resources you find. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">Breathing: <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Relaxed, deep breathing can often bring relief from trauma symptoms. Sit comfortably and gently fill your belly, chest, and shoulders on the in breath, and exhale your shoulders, chest, and belly. Breath comfortably\u2014don&#8217;t push or use effort\u2014but allow yourself to take slow, deep breaths. A few minutes of breathing this way can help calm you down. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">Physical health: <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Trauma survivors have weakened immune systems and are more vulnerable to getting sick. Get adequate rest and fresh water, go to nature, exercise, and avoid junk food. Consider a good-quality multi-vitamin\/multi-mineral supplement, with plenty of C and B. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">Psychiatric drugs: <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Anti-depressants, tranquilizers (benzodiazepines), and other psychiatric drugs may provide short term relief and can help with extreme anxiety and sleeplessness. However, these drugs have very risky side effects and are toxic to the body. Long-term use can lead to addiction, make sleeplessness and anxiety worse, interfere with the natural healing process, and overdose can be fatal. Avoid or use cautiously. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara'; font-weight: bold;\">Alternative medicines: <\/span><span style=\"font-size: 11.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Herbs, traditional remedies, and holistic care can be very effective for trauma. For example, after 9-11 and Hurricane Katrina, acupuncturists gave immediate relief to trauma survivors, including firefighters and medical personnel. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 9.000000pt; font-family: 'Candara';\">Written by Will Hall: wiltonhall@gmail.com.
